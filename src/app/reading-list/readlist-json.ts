    author: 'Er Gen',
    genre: ['fiction', 'Wuxia', 'fantasy'],
    details: 'A compelling and unique introduction into the world of Chinese martial arts fiction. The main character Meng Hao sets out' +
    ' on a journey that is reminiscent of ancient Greek epics but has a unique flavor due to the different cultural traditions of China' +
    ' as compared to Western fiction.\n' +
    'For me, this novel was the epitome of a page turner, and made me laugh and cry more than many other books that I would consider' +
    ' to be more technically impressive. The story has it’s share of Wuxia tropes, but it breaks past all of those with the wit and' +
    ' charm of its characters. If you have the time to spend on the over 1600 chapters of adventure this story provides, the time' +
    ' investment will reveal a whole new world of fantasy storytelling to you.',

    title: 'Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality',
    author: 'Eliezer Yudkowsky',
    genre: ['fiction', 'fantasy'],
    details: 'For all of its flaws, few books have resonated with me more than this one. The whole story exudes a particular charm that' +
    ' comes from Eliezer\'s skill at mixing the tragedy and comedy of the story that gives you breaks when you need them but never lets' +
    ' the reader completely relax their guard. Harry Potter was a big part of my childhood and revisiting the universe having seen more' +
    ' of the world I found this book’s take on the world to be more than satisfying.\n' +
    'If you want to see what it looks like when an fun magic coming of age story meets an engineer with a penchant for apocalypse,' +
    ' then read on (also there’s an audio version!).',
    tagline: '“And someday when the descendants of humanity have spread from star to star they won’t tell the children about the history' +

    genre: ['nonfiction', 'philosophy'],
    details: 'How do we talk about what it means to know something? How can we make decisions given the uncertainty of the world we live' +
    ' in? These questions fall within the wonderful realm of epistemics. This book which compiles Eliezer Yudkowsky’s writings is a' +
    ' great introduction to thinking critically about the nature of knowledge, as well as containing some interesting arguments about' +
    ' consciousness and morality. With distance I see more flaws in the book than when I first read it, but that doesn’t change the' +
    ' fact that I still see the book as the most accessible way to learn how to be a better critical thinking. Additional, the book' +
    ' draws heavily on several sources and so reading those is sure to provide hours of extra contemplation and will help to expand' +
    ' upon the book’s somewhat brief treatment of many subjects.',

    details: 'Richard Feynman has gotten a bad rap. I don’t think it’s unfair to say that he has been a large influence in forming' +
    ' what we see as the stereotypical quirky physicist. However, I will stand by my recommendation of this great book about the life' +
    ' of a guy who had that rare skill of making the complex simple. Feynman’s skill at communication is unparalleled, and he led a' +
    ' life that was full of twists and turns - from his work on the Manhattan project to the death of his wife. Inspiring characters' +
    ' help us to push ourselves further, and I think Feynman did was just that.',

    details: 'For someone like me with naturally utopian tendencies, this book was hard to read. I spent much of my life thinking' +
    ' about how we could use technology and science to bring order and improve the world. However, this book forced me to confront' +
    ' the reality that the naturally evolved mechanisms of society are more delicate than they might seem, and that to fix them may' +
    ' cause vast amounts of unexpected harm. I recommend this book heavily to anyone with an interest in the social and moral future' +
    ' of humanity, and the dangers that lay on the sides of the road.',
    tagline: '"We are now so prone to confuse great building projects with great social achievements. We will have to admit that it is' +

    details: 'Murakami is an author with a very distinctive style. He mixes the bizarre and the mundane into a wonderful journey that' +
    ' doesn’t follow a distinctive plot yet is still incredibly satisfying. This story has some incredibly potent imagery and has' +
    ' stayed in my head for years. I recommend it to anyone who likes the surreal and wants a mystery that will leave them feeling' +

    ' Discworld series, the main character is apprenticed to Death, and thus begins his journey towards understanding his new boss.' +
    ' In classic Discworld fashion the book is both funny and sobering. Terry Pratchett’s Death is one of my favorite characters in' +
