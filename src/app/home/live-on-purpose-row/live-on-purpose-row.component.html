          Outside of programming I like reading, and occasionally writing, about philosophy and science. For more casual
          reading I enjoy fantasy and science fiction. You can check out my reading list here:

          I participate in the <a href="https://www.gjopen.com/memberships/32814/scores">Good Judgement Open</a>
          to practice making better calibrated predictions. I recently spent several months working in South East
          Asia to try and gain some more varied perspectives on work and on life, and can only say that I'd highly
          recommend the experience. I'm always interested in learning new things, so if you have a book/podcast
          recommendation I'm always ready.
