          Outside of programming I like reading and occasionally writing about philosophy and science. For more casual
          reading I enjoy fantasy and science fiction, and have recently spent a lot of time reading Wuxia. You can check out my
          reading list here: <a href="/read">Reading List</a>.

          I participate in the <a href="https://www.gjopen.com/memberships/32814/scores">Good Judgement Open</a>
          to practice making better calibrated predictions. I also spend a fair bit of time learning Japanese, and
          see myself traveling to East Asia some time after I graduate from university. I'm always interested in learning
          new things, so I often watch MIT OpenCourseware lectures on topics outside of what I study at school.
